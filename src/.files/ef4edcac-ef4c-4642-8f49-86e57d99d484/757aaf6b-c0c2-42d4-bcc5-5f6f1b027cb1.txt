I'm a specialized AI assistant designed to help you with clinical metabolomics research. I can access scientific literature and provide evidence-based responses with citations.

I use multiple AI systems including:
• LightRAG with PDF knowledge base
• Perplexity AI via OpenRouter (with real-time web search)
• Intelligent fallback responses

To get started, simply ask me any question about clinical metabolomics!
