# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating LightRAG (Light Retrieval-Augmented Generation) into the Clinical Metabolomics Oracle system. The integration will be implemented in two phases: an MVP for standalone testing and development, followed by a comprehensive long-term solution that includes intelligent routing between LightRAG and existing systems. The goal is to enhance the system's knowledge retrieval capabilities by adding graph-based reasoning while maintaining compatibility with existing multi-language translation, citation processing, and confidence scoring features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MVP LightRAG Implementation

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a standalone LightRAG component that can ingest PDF papers and answer clinical metabolomics questions, so that I can evaluate its effectiveness before full integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user places PDF files in a `papers/` subfolder THEN the system SHALL automatically ingest and process these documents into a knowledge graph
2. WHEN the system processes PDF documents THEN it SHALL extract text content, create embeddings, and construct a knowledge graph with entities and relationships
3. WHEN a user asks "What is clinical metabolomics?" THEN the system SHALL provide an accurate answer based on information from the ingested papers
4. WHEN the LightRAG component is created THEN it SHALL be modular and importable into the existing Clinical Metabolomics Oracle pipeline
5. WHEN PDF ingestion occurs THEN the system SHALL handle common PDF formats and extract readable text with error handling for corrupted files
6. WHEN knowledge graph construction happens THEN the system SHALL identify biomedical entities, relationships, and concepts relevant to clinical metabolomics
7. WHEN query processing occurs THEN the system SHALL use graph traversal and semantic search to retrieve relevant information
8. WHEN the MVP is complete THEN it SHALL meet defined success metrics including answer accuracy and response time benchmarks

### Requirement 2: Modular Architecture Design

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LightRAG component to be designed with clear interfaces and separation of concerns, so that it can be easily integrated and maintained within the existing system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LightRAG component is designed THEN it SHALL have clearly defined interfaces for document ingestion, query processing, and response generation
2. WHEN the component is implemented THEN it SHALL follow the existing codebase patterns and architectural principles
3. WHEN integration occurs THEN the component SHALL not interfere with existing Neo4j, Perplexity API, or translation system functionality
4. WHEN the module is created THEN it SHALL include comprehensive error handling and logging capabilities
5. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL use environment variables and configuration files consistent with the existing system
6. WHEN testing is performed THEN the component SHALL include unit tests and integration tests with clear coverage metrics

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Routing System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically choose between LightRAG and Perplexity API based on my query type, so that I get the most appropriate and accurate response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL analyze the query type and context to determine the optimal response method
2. WHEN a query is about established knowledge in the ingested papers THEN the system SHALL route to LightRAG for graph-based retrieval
3. WHEN a query requires real-time or recent information THEN the system SHALL route to Perplexity API for web search
4. WHEN routing decisions are made THEN the system SHALL use LLM-based classification with configurable confidence thresholds
5. WHEN either system fails THEN the system SHALL implement fallback mechanisms to ensure response availability
6. WHEN routing occurs THEN the system SHALL log routing decisions for analysis and optimization
7. WHEN multiple sources are relevant THEN the system SHALL have the capability to combine responses from both LightRAG and Perplexity API

### Requirement 4: Integration with Existing Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want LightRAG responses to work seamlessly with existing translation, citation, and confidence scoring features, so that I maintain the same user experience across all query types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LightRAG generates a response THEN it SHALL be compatible with the existing multi-language translation system
2. WHEN responses are generated THEN they SHALL include proper citation information linking back to source PDF documents
3. WHEN answers are provided THEN they SHALL include confidence scores consistent with the existing scoring methodology
4. WHEN translation is requested THEN LightRAG responses SHALL be processed through the same translation pipeline as other responses
5. WHEN citations are displayed THEN they SHALL follow the existing citation format and include document metadata
6. WHEN confidence scoring occurs THEN it SHALL consider both graph-based evidence strength and source document reliability
7. WHEN the user interface displays results THEN LightRAG responses SHALL be visually consistent with existing response formats

### Requirement 5: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the LightRAG integration to handle increased document collections and user load efficiently, so that system performance remains acceptable as usage grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document collections grow THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable ingestion and query response times
2. WHEN multiple users query simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without significant performance degradation
3. WHEN knowledge graphs become large THEN the system SHALL implement efficient indexing and caching strategies
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade performance rather than failing
5. WHEN monitoring is implemented THEN the system SHALL track key performance metrics including response times, memory usage, and error rates
6. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the architecture SHALL support horizontal scaling of LightRAG components
7. WHEN maintenance occurs THEN the system SHALL support incremental updates to the knowledge base without full rebuilds

### Requirement 6: Maintenance and Updates

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want procedures for keeping the LightRAG knowledge base current with new research, so that the system provides up-to-date information to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new research papers are available THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for adding them to the knowledge base
2. WHEN documents are updated THEN the system SHALL handle incremental updates efficiently without full reprocessing
3. WHEN outdated information is identified THEN the system SHALL provide methods for removing or deprecating content
4. WHEN knowledge base updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain version control and rollback capabilities
5. WHEN automated updates are configured THEN the system SHALL monitor specified sources for new relevant papers
6. WHEN manual curation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide interfaces for content review and approval
7. WHEN update procedures run THEN they SHALL not disrupt ongoing user queries and system availability

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Robustness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback, so that I can understand issues and receive alternative responses when problems occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF processing fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue processing other documents
2. WHEN knowledge graph construction encounters errors THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and partial processing capabilities
3. WHEN query processing fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to alternative response methods and inform the user
4. WHEN external dependencies are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with reduced functionality
5. WHEN system errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging and monitoring
6. WHEN user-facing errors happen THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
7. WHEN recovery is possible THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt recovery procedures before failing

### Requirement 8: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing procedures and success metrics, so that I can validate the LightRAG integration meets performance and accuracy requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MVP testing occurs THEN the system SHALL accurately answer "What is clinical metabolomics?" with verifiable information from source papers
2. WHEN accuracy testing is performed THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 85% accuracy on a predefined set of clinical metabolomics questions
3. WHEN performance testing occurs THEN query response times SHALL be under 5 seconds for 95% of requests
4. WHEN integration testing happens THEN all existing system functionality SHALL continue to work without regression
5. WHEN load testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL handle at least 50 concurrent users without significant performance degradation
