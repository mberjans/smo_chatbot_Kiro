Clinical Metabolomics: An Overview

Clinical metabolomics is the application of metabolomics technologies and approaches to understand disease mechanisms, identify biomarkers, and support clinical decision-making. This field focuses on the comprehensive analysis of small molecules (metabolites) in biological samples such as blood, urine, and tissue.

Key Applications:
1. Disease Diagnosis: Metabolomics can identify metabolic signatures associated with specific diseases
2. Drug Development: Understanding how drugs affect metabolic pathways
3. Personalized Medicine: Tailoring treatments based on individual metabolic profiles
4. Biomarker Discovery: Finding metabolites that indicate disease states or treatment responses

Analytical Techniques:
- Mass Spectrometry (MS)
- Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy
- Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)
- Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)

Clinical metabolomics represents a powerful approach for advancing precision medicine and improving patient outcomes through better understanding of metabolic processes in health and disease.
