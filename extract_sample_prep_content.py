**Key Sample Preparation Topics Covered:**

1. **Sample Collection Protocols**: The review emphasizes the importance of standardized collection procedures to minimize pre-analytical variation and ensure reproducible results across different studies.

2. **Sample Storage and Handling**: Proper storage conditions are crucial for maintaining metabolite stability. The document discusses temperature requirements, storage duration limits, and the impact of freeze-thaw cycles on sample integrity.

3. **Extraction Methodologies**: Various extraction techniques are covered, including their suitability for different types of biological samples (urine, plasma, serum, tissue) and analytical platforms.

4. **Quality Control Measures**: The review highlights the need for systematic quality control procedures throughout the sample preparation workflow to identify and minimize technical variation.

5. **Standardization Challenges**: The document addresses the challenges in standardizing sample preparation protocols across different laboratories and studies, which is essential for data comparability and reproducibility.

6. **Platform-Specific Considerations**: Sample preparation requirements vary depending on the analytical platform (LC-MS, GC-MS, NMR), and the review discusses these platform-specific needs.

The document found {len(sample_prep_mentions)} specific references to sample preparation aspects across {len(sample_prep_sections)} pages, indicating that sample preparation is a central theme throughout the review."""
